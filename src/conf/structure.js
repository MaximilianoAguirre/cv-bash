Infrastructure was defined modularly using Terraform to cover different client use cases. Frontend was created in React and backend was created in Python using FastAPI, both hosted as serverless services in AWS. Automations were created using AWS services (lambda, systems manager, step functions, etc.) to create and support resources behind the scenes (VMs, shared storage using FSx, EFS). SSO was implemented as a combination of Active Directory for server access and Cognito (with federated identities to other IdPs) to grant authentication and authorization to the app.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Maximiliano Aguirre and this is a fun rework of mi CV.

If you were able to print this, you are probably familiar with bash interpreter. This is by no means a bash app running somehow in the javascript environment of the browser, but a cheap emulator of it in javascript done just for fun as a different way of presenting my CV.

Reading my CV from here should be an enjoyable activity for anyone used to use a terminal, but you are free to download a PDF version of my CV either by running 'open pdf' or by using the PDF button on the top right of the screen.
